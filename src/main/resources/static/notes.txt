Want an automated system to monitor and restart our Flask application
So that the application remains available even after server restarts or unexpected crashes


Our MMBot and JiraBot on a development server. Currently, the application is started manually using nohup python server.py.
However, this approach doesn't ensure the application's continuous availability, especially after server restarts or if the application crashes unexpectedly.
We need a robust solution that automatically monitors the application's status and restarts it when necessary, while also managing log files efficiently


Monitor and Restart:
Automatically check if the Flask app is running every minute
Restart the app using nohup if it's not running


Log Management:
Append all outputs to a log file
Rotate log files daily


Persistence:
The monitoring system starts automatically on server boot
Continues running until manually stopped


Usability:
Provide simple instructions for setup and use
Allow easy configuration of app name and log directory


Testing:
Demonstrate successful app restart after a simulated crash


Title: Enhance Email-to-HTML Conversion to Include Embedded Images

Description
As a user, I want the email-to-HTML conversion process to include images embedded within the email so that the resulting
HTML is a complete and accurate representation of the original email content.

Currently, our tool converts email text to HTML but does not handle images, resulting in missing visual information in the converted files.
The enhancement will modify our existing script to detect and embed images as data URIs directly in the HTML,
ensuring that the output is self-contained and visually consistent with the original email.

Acceptance Criteria

Detect and Convert Images:
The tool should recognize all images attached in the email.
Each image should be converted into a data URI format.

Embed Images in HTML:
Images must appear in the HTML as <img> tags at the correct points in the content.
The HTML should look like the original email, with all text and images in place.

Content Accuracy:
The converted HTML should maintain the original email's layout and formatting.
Ensure that no parts of the email, such as text or images, are lost in conversion.

Handle Various Emails:
The tool should successfully convert emails that have multiple images.
It should also handle emails without any images, ensuring the text content is still properly converted to HTML.

Testing:
Ensure the HTML output accurately reflects the content and structure of the original email.


Title: Implement Subscription-Based Email Notification System

Description
As a user, I want the system to notify me immediately when a new email arrives so that I can process emails in real-time, reducing the response time and system load compared to the current long polling method.

Acceptance Criteria

Subscription Setup:
The system must subscribe to new email notifications.
New emails should trigger a callback function.

Real-Time Processing:
The system should process emails within seconds of their arrival.
Ensure that each new email triggers the designated processing logic without user intervention.

Accuracy:
All new emails must be detected and processed.
No emails should be missed or processed more than once.

Testing:
Testing should confirm that the system handles rapid successive email arrivals.
