Energy-Efficient Software Development


Migrating Existing APIs to energy efficient APIs
Develop a migration toolkit to transition JSON/REST and SOAP/XML APIs to gRPC with Protocol Buffers. Create a measurement framework to quantify energy savings in data centers and mobile devices, focusing on reduced data transfer, efficient serialization, and decreased processing overhead."


Automated code analysis for energy efficiency
Develop a SonarQube plugin that performs automated code analysis for energy efficiency. The plugin should identify energy hotspots, suggest optimizations, and provide metrics for energy consumption in CI/CD pipelines."


Most of these will be driven by codecarbon - Python Library


Transforming Monoliths with ArchUnit, Moduliths, and Microservice

As software architectures evolve, ensuring their integrity and maintainability becomes paramount. This presentation introduces a novel approach to modernizing monolithic applications by transitioning to modular monoliths, or "moduliths," and eventually to microservices. Central to this journey is ArchUnit, a powerful tool for validating architectural rules and enforcing modular boundaries. We will demonstrate how ArchUnit can be used to maintain a clean architecture within monoliths, moduliths, and microservices, highlighting its role in automated architecture validation. Through practical examples, learn how to enhance scalability and maintainability in your applications, paving the way for a seamless evolution from monoliths to microservices. Join us to discover how ArchUnit can transform your approach to architectural integrity, ensuring your applications remain robust and adaptable.
