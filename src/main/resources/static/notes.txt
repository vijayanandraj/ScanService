Objective:
The Green Computing Hackathon Challenge is designed to spark curiosity and innovation among developers by focusing on energy-efficient programming practices.
Participants will engage in various coding tasks aimed at optimizing software for reduced energy consumption, all within the confines of BAND laptops.
This hackathon encourages hands-on learning and application of green computing concepts without requiring additional infrastructure.

Themes:

Theme 1: Energy Efficiency Comparisons

Comparing Energy Efficiency: REST vs gRPC
Develop a comprehensive benchmarking suite to compare the energy efficiency of gRPC-based Protocol Buffers applications with traditional REST/JSON applications. The goal is to quantify the energy savings and performance improvements that can be achieved by using gRPC over REST/JSON for different types of operations and data loads.

Comparing Energy Efficiency: Native Compiled vs. VM Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages
Develop a comprehensive benchmarking suite to compare the energy efficiency of native compiled languages (e.g., Rust, C++), compiled languages running on a virtual machine (e.g., Java, C#), and interpreted languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, etc.). The goal is to measure and analyze the energy consumption, performance, and resource utilization of various computational tasks implemented in these different types of languages.

Theme 2: Green Coding Practices
Guide for Green Coding Practices:
Develop an interactive guide that educates users on green coding practices. The guide should provide practical tips, real-time feedback, and educational resources to promote energy-efficient coding and software operations.

Theme 3: Code Optimization
Optimizing Legacy Code for Energy Efficiency:
Take a piece of legacy code (available in various languages) and optimize it for energy efficiency. Participants should measure the energy consumption before and after optimization and provide detailed reports on their improvements.


Theme 4: Algorithm and Data Structure Efficiency
Energy-Efficient Algorithms
Implement common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversal) in the most energy-efficient way possible. Compare different implementations to find the most energy-efficient solution.

Sustainable Data Structures
Analyze and implement different data structures to determine which are the most energy-efficient for various operations (e.g., insertions, deletions, searches). Provide a comparative study.

Goal:
By the end of the hackathon, participants will have developed a deeper understanding of green computing practices, learned to optimize code for energy efficiency, and created solutions that contribute to a more sustainable future. The focus is on practical, hands-on experience that can be immediately applied to real-world software development scenarios.

Impact:
This hackathon aims to promote environmentally conscious coding practices, reduce the carbon footprint of software applications, and encourage a culture of sustainability within the developer community.
