Given the Flask application is not running
When the monitoring system checks the application status
Then the system should restart the application using nohup
Log Management:
Given the Flask application is running and logging output
When a new day starts
Then the system should create a new log file for that day
Given log files older than 7 days exist
When the system performs its daily check
Then it should delete these old log files
Persistence:
Given the server has just booted up
When the operating system has finished loading
Then the monitoring system should start automatically
Usability:
Given a new developer wants to use the monitoring system
When they read the provided instructions
Then they should be able to set up and configure the system without additional assistance
Testing:
Given the Flask application is running and being monitored
When the application is manually terminated to simulate a crash
Then the monitoring system should detect this and restart the application within one minute

Acceptance Criteria in Given-When-Then Format
Given I am subscribed to the mailbox,
When a new email arrives,
Then the system should immediately trigger the callback function.

Given a new email has triggered the callback function,
When the email is processed,
Then it should be processed within seconds of its arrival without manual intervention.

Given the email notification system is operational,
When new emails arrive,
Then all new emails should be detected and processed accurately, with no emails missed or processed more than once.

Given the system is set up for testing,
When rapid successive emails are simulated to arrive,
Then the system should handle them without crashing or missing any emails.

Given typical system usage,
When the system processes incoming emails,
Then it should remain stable and perform within the expected parameters.


Acceptance Criteria in Given-When-Then Format
Detect and Convert Images:

Given an email with attached images,
When the email is processed,
Then the tool should recognize all images and convert each image into a data URI format.

Want an automated system to monitor and restart our Flask application
So that the application remains available even after server restarts or unexpected crashes


Our MMBot and JiraBot on a development server. Currently, the application is started manually using nohup python server.py.
However, this approach doesn't ensure the application's continuous availability, especially after server restarts or if the application crashes unexpectedly.
We need a robust solution that automatically monitors the application's status and restarts it when necessary, while also managing log files efficiently


Monitor and Restart:
Automatically check if the Flask app is running every minute
Restart the app using nohup if it's not running


Log Management:
Append all outputs to a log file
Rotate log files daily


Persistence:
The monitoring system starts automatically on server boot
Continues running until manually stopped


Usability:
Provide simple instructions for setup and use
Allow easy configuration of app name and log directory


Testing:
Demonstrate successful app restart after a simulated crash


Title: Enhance Email-to-HTML Conversion to Include Embedded Images

Description
As a user, I want the email-to-HTML conversion process to include images embedded within the email so that the resulting
HTML is a complete and accurate representation of the original email content.

Currently, our tool converts email text to HTML but does not handle images, resulting in missing visual information in the converted files.
The enhancement will modify our existing script to detect and embed images as data URIs directly in the HTML,
ensuring that the output is self-contained and visually consistent with the original email.

Acceptance Criteria

Detect and Convert Images:
The tool should recognize all images attached in the email.
Each image should be converted into a data URI format.

Embed Images in HTML:
Images must appear in the HTML as <img> tags at the correct points in the content.
The HTML should look like the original email, with all text and images in place.

Content Accuracy:
The converted HTML should maintain the original email's layout and formatting.
Ensure that no parts of the email, such as text or images, are lost in conversion.

Handle Various Emails:
The tool should successfully convert emails that have multiple images.
It should also handle emails without any images, ensuring the text content is still properly converted to HTML.

Testing:
Ensure the HTML output accurately reflects the content and structure of the original email.


Title: Implement Subscription-Based Email Notification System

Description
As a user, I want the system to notify me immediately when a new email arrives so that I can process emails in real-time, reducing the response time and system load compared to the current long polling method.

Acceptance Criteria

Subscription Setup:
The system must subscribe to new email notifications.
New emails should trigger a callback function.

Real-Time Processing:
The system should process emails within seconds of their arrival.
Ensure that each new email triggers the designated processing logic without user intervention.

Accuracy:
All new emails must be detected and processed.
No emails should be missed or processed more than once.

Testing:
Testing should confirm that the system handles rapid successive email arrivals.
