Iâ€™m thinking of revamping our software distribution with a Developer App Store as a desktop app. It would feature AppBundles, letting tech leads create and share toolsets for quick, consistent setup. The app would run in the background, notifying devs of updates to avoid compliance issues and streamline installs. We can also incorporate quick help for common issues like IDE setups or environment variable fixes, and include support features like FAQs and potentially a chatbot. This should boost productivity, keep our environments standardized, and reduce support requests.
